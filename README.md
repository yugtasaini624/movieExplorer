# 🎬 Movie Explorer

Movie Explorer is a responsive React application that allows users to browse and explore movies with ease. Users can view movie cards on the home page, open a detailed page for each movie, and read more about the project on the About page. A custom 404 page handles invalid routes gracefully.
